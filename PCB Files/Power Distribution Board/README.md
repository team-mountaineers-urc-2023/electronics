# Power Distribution Board

## Overview
The Power Distribution Board includes DC/DC converters used to step down the battery power to the necessary voltages needed throughout the rover. It can be populated with up to three 40 or 60W Traco Power DC/DC converters as well as two 20W regulators. It also includes integrated emergency stop circuitry and two pass-through power rails.

## Features
- 2-layer board
- Supports up to four batteries powering DC/DC converters
- Allows up to three 40W or 60W regulators
- Includes up to two 20W regulators
- Two pass-through voltage rails allowing unregulated power directly from batteries
- In-rush current limiters on drive motor connections
- Connectors have selectable outputs - jumpers determine which regulator they are attached to
- E-stop bypass allows the computer to remain powered when the emergency stop is used
